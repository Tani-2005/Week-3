# Week-3
# Sales Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
The Sales Data Analysis project is a beginner-level Python project that focuses on analyzing real-world data using the pandas library. The program loads a sales dataset from a CSV file, explores its structure, performs basic data cleaning, and calculates key sales metrics to generate meaningful insights.

This project introduces the fundamentals of data analysis and demonstrates how Python can be used to work with structured data.
